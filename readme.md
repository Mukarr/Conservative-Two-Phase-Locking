##Conservative Two-Phase Locking

- It is a concurrency control method that guarantees **serializability**.
- The whole list of transactions are know beforehand.
- All the locks are aquired at start of each transaction.
- This ensure **no deadlock**.

## Usage

- Random input transactions generation
```
python3 generate_tx.py -x [num_transactions] -i [max_instructions] -t [max_time] -v [num_variable]
```

`num_transactions`: Total number of transactions to the system.

`max_instructions`: Maximum number of instruction any transaction can generate.

`max_time`: Maximum time till which system proceeds.

`num_variable`: Total number of variable in the system.

- Conservative two-phase Locking
```
python3 twophase_locking_conservative.py [--verbose]
```

`verbose_output`: Print output to screen verboselly

The will take the input generated by `generate_tx.py`.

## Example Usage

```
python3 generate_tx.py -x 5 -i 10 -t 10 -v 5 | python3 twophase_locking_conservative.py --verbose
```

- This will generate a system with **5 transactions**, each with maximum of **10 instructions**, with **5 variable** in total and the system's lifetime being **10 seconds**.

- This random set of transactions is piped to `twophase_locking_conservative.py`, which generates the required schedule.
